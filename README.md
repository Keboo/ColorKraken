# ColorKraken

A simple WPF application for editing GitKraken themes.
[GitKraken v8.2.0](https://support.gitkraken.com/release-notes/current/#version-820) introduced custom color themes. This simple desktop applications allows for easy editing of those themes. To get started simply download the app from the latest [Release](https://github.com/Keboo/ColorKraken/releases)

Though the color picker on each theme color defaults to an RGB value, the theming in GitKraken supports more advanced CSS functions (such as lighten(), fade(), etc). Check out the existing themes to get an idea of what is possible. 

Once you create a theme, in GitKraken, open Preferences >> UI Customization and select your new theme from the Theme drop down. Once selected changes you make in this app will appear immediately in GitKraken. Check out changing `app__bg0` to change the main application background color for a very noticiple change.
